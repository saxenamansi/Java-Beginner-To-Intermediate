1. Create a program to take input from the user as 1 /2 /3, if user enters 1, display info about Arithmetic Exception, 2 and 3 for Null pointer exception and Array index out of bound exception, respectively. Use, Try, Catch block for each exception individually.

2. Create a user defined exception class by extending the exception class to handle two kinds of scenario, where (1) input cannot be negative (2) input cannot be in the range 0 to
25 Throw object of user defined exception class and handle it by using nested try block with specific exceptions catch block. Also define finally block in the program.

3. ***MGR Question*** : Design a class to display the schedule of trains in MGR Central railway station. The class can have its own member variable like, train_no, src, dest, time, traveltime, platformno, traveltype (A Arrival, D-Departure). Create an array of objects in main function. Perform the following tasks. <br>
a) SearchFunction () Takes trainno has input and performs a search with all objects. If found display all variable details of the class like train_no, src, dest, time, traveltime, platformno, traveltype. If not found throw arrayIndexOutofBound exception and handle it. <br>
b) SortFunction () - Takes the input of sorting type (TM- time based, TN - Train no based). Sort and display the records. If the user enters other than TN or TM input throw arithematic or arrayIndexOutofBound exception and handle it.
