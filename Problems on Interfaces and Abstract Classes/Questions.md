# Programs on Interface and Abstract Classes and Packages and Inheritance

1. Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in working with user-defined packages and sub-packages. Eg., Within the package named ‘primespackage’, define a
class Primes which includes a method checkForPrime() for checking if the given number is prime or not. Define another class named TwinPrimes outside of this package which
will display all the pairs of prime numbers whose difference is 2. (Eg, within the range 1 to 10, all possible twin prime numbers are (3,5), (5,7)). The TwinPrimes class should make
use of the checkForPrime() method in the Primes class.

2. Write an interface called Exam with a method Pass ( ) that returns the total marks. Write another interface called Classify with a method Average (int total) which returns a string.
Write a Class called Result which implements both Exam and Classify. The Pass method should get the marks from the user and finds the total marks and return. The Division
method calculate the average marks and return “First” if the average is 60 or more, “SECOND” when average is 50 or more but below 60, “NO DIVISION” when average is less than 50.

3. Write an abstract class special with an abstract method double Process (double P,double R). Create a subclass Discount and implement the Process() method with the following
formula: net=P- P\*R/100. Return the Process() method with the following formula: total=P+P\*R/100. Return the total.
