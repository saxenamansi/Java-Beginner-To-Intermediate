# Programs on Interface and Abstract Classes and Packages and Inheritance

1. ***Twin Prime Packages Question*** : Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in working with user-defined packages and sub-packages. Eg., Within the package named ‘primespackage’, define a class Primes which includes a method checkForPrime() for checking if the given number is prime or not. Define another class named TwinPrimes outside of this package which will display all the pairs of prime numbers whose difference is 2. (Eg, within the range 1 to 10, all possible twin prime numbers are (3,5), (5,7)). The TwinPrimes class should make use of the checkForPrime() method in the Primes class.

2. ***Exam Result Question*** : Write an interface called Exam with a method Pass ( ) that returns the total marks. Write another interface called Classify with a method Average (int total) which returns a string. Write a Class called Result which implements both Exam and Classify. The Pass method should get the marks from the user and finds the total marks and return. The Division method calculate the average marks and return “First” if the average is 60 or more, “SECOND” when average is 50 or more but below 60, “NO DIVISION” when average is less than 50.

3. ***Simple Interest Question*** : Write an abstract class special with an abstract method double Process (double P,double R). Create a subclass Discount and implement the Process() method with the following formula: net=P- P\*R/100. Return the Process() method with the following formula: total=P+P\*R/100. Return the total.

4. ***Bank Account Question*** : Create an abstract class Account that has a balance attribute, a method to ask enquiries, and 2 abstract methods to credit and debit money from the account balance. Extend 2 classes, SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount and define the abstract methods. Add an attribute interest rate and a method to calculate the interest in the SavingsAccount class, while in CheckingAccount, add an attibute fee, that is deducted from the balance when money is credited or debited from the account. 

5. ***Summer Vacation Question*** : Make a class Vacation with necessary attributes and methods to set and print the attributes. Extend this class using inheritance to define a class Summer Vacation. Override the methods defined in the parent class, Vacation. 

6. ***Sum and Average Question*** : Define an interface Numbers which declares a method Process that takes two values as parameters. Define 2 classes that implement Interface - Sum, where the method Process is defined as the sum of two input numbers, and Average, where the method Process is defined as the Average of two input numbers.

7. ***TestDetails Question*** : 
8. ***GCD Question*** : 
9. ***Jio Charges Question*** :
10. ***Class Highest and Average Marks*** :
