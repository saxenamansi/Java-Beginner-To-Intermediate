# Programs on Interface and Abstract Classes and Packages and Inheritance

1. ***Twin Prime Packages Question*** : Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in working with user-defined packages and sub-packages. Eg., Within the package named ‘primespackage’, define a class Primes which includes a method checkForPrime() for checking if the given number is prime or not. Define another class named TwinPrimes outside of this package which will display all the pairs of prime numbers whose difference is 2. (Eg, within the range 1 to 10, all possible twin prime numbers are (3,5), (5,7)). The TwinPrimes class should make use of the checkForPrime() method in the Primes class.

2. ***Exam Result Question*** : Write an interface called Exam with a method Pass ( ) that returns the total marks. Write another interface called Classify with a method Average (int total) which returns a string. Write a Class called Result which implements both Exam and Classify. The Pass method should get the marks from the user and finds the total marks and return. The Division method calculate the average marks and return “First” if the average is 60 or more, “SECOND” when average is 50 or more but below 60, “NO DIVISION” when average is less than 50.

3. ***Simple Interest Question*** : Write an abstract class special with an abstract method double Process (double P,double R). Create a subclass Discount and implement the Process() method with the following formula: net=P- P\*R/100. Return the Process() method with the following formula: total=P+P\*R/100. Return the total.

4. ***Bank Account Question*** : Create an inheritance hierarchy in java using following information given below that a bank might use to represent customers’ bank accounts. Base class Account should include one data member of type double to represent account balance. The class should provide constructor that receives an initial balance and uses it to initialize the data member.The constructor should validate the initial balance to ensure that it is greater than or equal to 0.If not the balance is set to 0.0 and the constructor should display an error message,indicating that the initial balance was invalid. The class also provides three member functions credit, debit(debit amount should not exceed the account balance) and enquiry.Derived class SavingsAccount should inherit the functionality of an Account, but also include data member of type double indicating the interest rate assigned to the Account. SavingsAccount constructor should receive the initial balance, as well as an initial value for SavingsAccount’s interest rate. SavingsAccount should provide public member function calculateInterest that returns double indicating the amount of interest earned by an account.The method calculateInterest should determine this amount by multiplying the interest rate by the account balance.SavingsAccount function should inherit member functions credit, debit and enquiry without redefining them. Derived class CheckingAccount should inherit the functionality of an Account, but also include data member of type double that represents the fee charged per transaction. CheckingAccount constructor should receive the initial balance, as well as parameter indicating fee amount. class CheckingAccount should redefine credit and debit function so that they subtract the fee from account balance whenever either transaction is performed. CheckingAccount’s debit function should charge a fee only if the money is actually withdrawn (debit amount should not exceed the account balance).After defining the class hierarchy, write program that creates object of each class and tests their member functions. Add interest to SavingAccount object by first invoking its calculateInterest function, then passing the returned interest amount to object’s credit function. 

5. ***Bank Account Question with abstract classes*** :  Modify the above program by defining the parent class to be an abstract class. 

6. ***Summer Vacation Question*** : Create a class called vacation with Data members: (1) Place, (2) Date, (3) Activities (array of elements), (4) Cost of each activity (array of elements), Methods: (1) GetMethod, (2) PrintMethod. Inherit the data members and methods to a new class called “SummerVacation” and include the data members: (1) CourseTitle
(2) OnlinePlatform (eg: nptel, courseera, udemey..), (3) Duration, Methods: (1) GetMethod, (2) PrintMethod, (3) Calculate the total cost spent in vacation by creating static method.

7. ***Summer Vacation Question using Interfaces*** : Make necessary changes in the Summer Vacation Question by creating an interface vacation and implement it in a class SummerVacation as given above. 

8. ***Sum and Average Question*** : Write an interface called Numbers, withamethodintProcess(intx,inty). Write a class called Sum, in which the method Process finds the sum of two numbers and returns an int value. Write another class called Average, in which the process method finds the average of the two numbers and returns an int. 

9. ***GCD Question*** : In a school, students of all classes from std I to X appear for the MathPremierLeague examination. Define a class MPL which stores the details of the marks scored by each class. It should contain the following 4 data members: Standard, number of students, marks[] array to store the scores of all the students of the class in MPL exam and first mark. Create an array of 4 objects for this class. Define a parameterized constructor which receives the values for the first two data members from the main() method. From within the constructor, read the marks of all students and hence find the first mark. Define a method findBestClass() to display the standard which has secured the highest first mark. Overload this method to display the standard with the highest class average. The marks array should be declared dynamically based on the strength of the class. 

10. ***Jio Charges Question*** : Create a class by name JioCharges with the following members. Instance Members : Customer Name, Number of calls made to Jio, Number of calls made to other services and BillAmount. Write a main class to test the program for an array of objects. Note: Use the following information to calculate the amount to be paid. <br> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60805302/128843640-b1fa2108-3a43-4bf0-8a2a-6de1291e1f7a.png) <br>
i) number of calls field is declared as private. (Use read and write property to access it) <br>
ii) A default constructor <br>
iii) A parameterized constructor functions to initialize the instance members with the values specified by the user. <br>
iv) A getData( ) method to read input details from the user. <br>
v) A method calculateBillAmount( ) to calculate the amount to be paid for the calls. <br>

11. ***MPL Question*** : In a school, students of all classes from std I to X appear for the MathPremierLeague examination. Define a class MPL which stores the details of the marks scored by each class. It should contain the following 4 data members: Standard, number of students, marks[] array to store the scores of all the students of the class in MPL exam and first mark. Create an array of 4 objects for this class. Define a parameterized constructor which receives the values for the first two data members from the main() method. From within the constructor, read the marks of all students and hence find the first mark. Define a method findBestClass() to display the standard which has secured the highest first mark. Overload this method to display the standard with the highest class average. The marks array should be declared dynamically based on the strength of the class. 

12. ***Person Packages Question*** : Create a class person with datamembers like name, age, phno with methods getvalues and printvalues, store the class in a package called pack1. Define a class named student in subpackage SubPack1 and extend the class defined as person. Use this class in a program of different package Pack2, create an object and invoke the methods defined in pack1 class file.
